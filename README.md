# Project

This project is client-server chat shell application written in C created as my final project for Oregon State Intro To Computer Networks (CS372).

# How to run

Compile executables

```bash
make
```

Start server in one terminal (this example uses port number 55661 but you can use any available port number)

```bash
./server 55661
```

Start server in one terminal (use same port number as server)

```bash
./client 55661
```

# Example
'>' dictates incoming message on client and server
